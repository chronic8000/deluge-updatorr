What's was it
-------------

*deluge-updatorr is a Deluge plugin for automatic torrents updates.*

If you're periodically checking your favourite torrent tracker site,
on which torrents are organized as articles (i.e forum-like tracker),
to verify whether specific torrents have been updated (e.g. torrent
bundling some TV-series is updated with a new episode), then Updatorr
is might be of use.

You activate Updatorr plugin, set autoupdate period and trackers sites
credentials, choose torrents to be updated from Deluge torrents list,
and Updatorr will do checks for you. When torrent update is available,
Updatorr will replace old torrent with an updated one, and download
new files from new torrent.

Automatic updates are available for:

    * RuTracker.org (ex torrents.ru) - http://rutracker.org/
    * RUTOR - http://rutor.org/
    * AniDUB - http://tr.anidub.com/

*Deluge is a lightweight, Free Software, cross-platform BitTorrent client.*
